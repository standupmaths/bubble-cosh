# bubble-cosh

This repository contains the code used for Matt's bubble calculations, as featured in ["The bubble that breaks maths."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31Om4VrSzb8)

`bubble_cosh.py` is the original source code from the video. Code in the `community` folder has been provided by other contributors!

## Usage

Run `bubble_cosh.py`. The values of `d` and `l` are passed in as command-line
arguments. (`bubble_cosh.py --help` will give a help menu.)

Run `pytest` to test the example in Matt's video (rounded to 5 decimal places).

## Contributing

You're welcome to contribute! There are a few different places that your PR could target:

- Bug fixes will be accepted directly in to the original code.

- The `community` folder has been created as a place for any further scripts.

- If you've done a bigger bit of work, consider keeping this in your own repository, and opening a PR to update the Further Work section below.
